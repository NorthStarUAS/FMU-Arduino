# IMU calibration

* calibrated sensors produce better ekf results than uncalibrated sensors and
  also leads to quicker convergence, so calibration is an important
  consideration.

* calibration can get complicated so this is my attempt to think through and
  document the strategy used.

## Two levels of calibration

Level 1 orientation correction is applied first, and the 2nd level is applied on
top of that.

1. Correction for basic sensor alignment/mounting errors.  Correction is
represented as a rotation matrix R, which should be a pure rotation matix
R*R(transpose) = Identity.

2. After the alignment correction, the second level calibration is applied.
Gyros are zero'd at the start, acclerometers have a bias correction based on a
temperature fit model.  Magnetometers have a full affine matrix correction.

## Data messages

The intent is for the alignment correction calibration to be 'ubiquitous',
quiet, and hidden.  That is setup once and then shouldn't need to be changed.

* "raw" sensor values refer to post-alignment correction, but pre-second level
  correction.  The pure original, raw, completely untouched, values from the
  sensors are never saved or used.

  "raw" sensor values can be logged and used to improve future calibration fits.

* "corrected" sensor values are post calibration, and are the values fed into
  the EKF or used for other operations downstream.

  "corrected" sensor values can later be replayed through an offline EKF and
  should produce results similar to the real time results
