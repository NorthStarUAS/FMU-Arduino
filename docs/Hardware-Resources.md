# Hardware Resources

## PJRC (FMU)

* <https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/>
* Teensy 4.0 and 4.1: 600Mhz Cortex-M7 with boatloads of RAM, Storage, and IO
  pins. Programmable with the standard Arduino-IDE and C++ code.

## BeagleBoard.org (Companion Computer)

* <https://www.beagleboard.org/boards/beaglebone-black>
* BeagleBone Black: Linux companion computer, low power draw (especially
  compared to a modern raspberry pi), but still highly capable and well
  supported.  Marmot-1.7 boards directly plug in and have connected UART and
  several port pass throughs.

## Boulder Flight Systems (FMU, Sensors, Cables)

* <https://bolderflight.com/>
* Offers a teensy "compatible" based flight management computer/board with a
  30x30mm footprint.  They may also continue to offer their marmot board which
  has a footprint that plugs directly into a beaglebone black.
* Also may offer a selection of compatible sensors and cables.

## 3DR/MRO (Jordie Munoz) (Sensors, Cables)

* <https://store.3dr.com/>
* Sells a variety of sensors boards, and cables.  For things like
  gps, airdata, and radio modems, this is the goto place.  Note, this project
  uses a teensy as a flight controller, not a pixhawk-based board, so the 3dr
  flight controllers are not compatible here.

## Digikey

* JST-GH precrimped wires (combined with connectors you can build your own custom cables)
