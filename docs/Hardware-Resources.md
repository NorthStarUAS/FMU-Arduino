  pins. Programmable with the standard Arduino-IDE and C++ code.

* BeagleBone Black: Linux companion computer, low power draw (especially
  compared to a modern raspberry pi), but still highly capable and well
  supported.  Marmot-1.7 boards directly plug in and have connected UART and
  several port pass throughs.

* Bolder Flight Systems: Offers a teensy "compatible" based flight management
  computer/board with a 30x30mm footprint.

* 3DR (Jordie) sells a variety of boards, sensors, and cables.  For things like
  gps, airdata, and radio modems, this is the goto place.
